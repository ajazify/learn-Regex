### 1. **Basics of Regex Syntax**

#### Key Patterns:

| Pattern |Description  | Example |
|--|--| --|
| . | Any single character | `a.c` â†’ `abc` |
| * | Zero or more of preceding | `ab*c` â†’ `abc` |
| + | One or more of preceding | `ab+c` â†’ `abbc` |
| ? | Optional character | `colou?r` â†’ `color`/`colour` |
| \d | Any digit (0â€“9) | `\d{3}` â†’ `123` |
| \w | Any word character | `\w+` â†’ `hello1` |
| [abc] | Any of a, b, or c | `b[aeiou]g` â†’ `bag` |
| ^ | Start of string | `^abc` |
| $ | End of string | `xyz$` |


### 2. **Practical Use Cases**

#### Example 1: Validate Email

``` 
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`
```
---
#### Example 2: Validate Indian Phone Number

```
^[6-9]\d{9}$
```
---
#### Example 3: Extract Hashtags from Text

```
#(\w+)
```
